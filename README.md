# Prism

This a project to build C2 infrastructure for pentesting and collaborative CTF. It can:

- Build and deploy a pentesting box with a good collection of modern tools effortlessly on aws.
- Standup C2 infrastructure with minimal effort. Covenant, Empire/Starkiller and Metasploit are ready to go.
- Teams can remotely collaborate in a shared terminal environment. Catch reverse shells and allow multiple team members to interact with them at the same time.
- Automate activities that take time like firewall management, distributing and staging payloads, proxies/pivoting and backups.
